- 🧠 **Text Generation AI** — Built with TensorFlow and Keras for creative text output.
- 🖼️ **Image Classification Models** — CNNs for recognizing fruits, vegetables, and more.
- 📊 **Prediction & Classification** — Data-driven insights using supervised learning.
- 🔍 **Search Engine Prototypes** — AI-powered data indexing and retrieval.
- 🛠️ Tools and utilities built with:
  - TensorFlow
  - Keras
  - Scikit-learn
  - Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib

## 📁 Structure

Each folder contains:
- Source code (`.py` files or notebooks)
- Model training data or links to datasets
- Usage instructions and output examples
- Requirements file (`requirements.txt`)

## 💡 Purpose

This repo is designed to:
